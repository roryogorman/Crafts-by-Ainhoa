# Crafts by Ainhoa
## Purpose
There are two purposes in the creation of this website.
* This is my Milestone 1 Project which is part of the Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development Diploma course. 
This project demonstrates the skills and knowledge that I have picked up studying the HTML, CSS & User Centric Frontend Development modules
* This website is also being built to market the crafting products created by the 'Crafts by Ainhoa' company. The aim is to give a web presence to the company,
attract both new customers & those familiar with her work, showcase & market the merchandise. 

The website is designed to be accessed and viewed on all smart devices, laptops & PCs.

The live website is available [here](https://roryogorman.github.io/Crafts-by-Ainhoa/)

### Design 
#### Colour Scheme
- To reflect the subject matter & aims of the site, I will be using soft colours throughout the site e.g. soft yellows, oranges, purples, etc. I feel that using these shades adds to the attractiveness of the site and is very appropriate.
- The main colour used as a background for the NavBar & Footer is #989572 - a dark grayish yellow which I feel suits the purpose of the website well, and also blends very well with the background image.
- Other colours have been chosen which complement the #989572 colour. These are:
    - a. #E0D8DE: A warm grey colour, used as the text colour
    - b. #727598: A dark greyish blue colour, used as a colour for the 'Shop Now' button, as well as the hover colour for social media icons. 
    - c. #957298: A dark greyish magenta colour, used as a background for the User Review section.

#### Typography
- Two fonts were used primarily for this site - Rochester & Baskervville. These are two fonts that are commonly used in craft websites and are both clean, clear & very readable and so I feel are appropriate for this site
- For the Site Title in the NavBar & 'Shop Now' buttons, I have used the Rochester font. I feel that it looks artistic & it fits to the overall feel of the site.
- From researching other leading craft websites e.g. lovecrafts.com & mookko.co.uk, these sites use typography such as these throughout which makes their sites look very attractive.

#### Imagery
For a site that will be primarily used to sell the merchandise of the vendor, imagery is hugely important - having a visual site with just the necessary commentary is usual practice for site such as this.
As such, I have used stock imagery for background images on th Home & Shop page and have used images of products already created by the vendor in the Gallery tab. This gives the viewer a clear visual representation of the subject matter, aims and purposes of this site.

### Wireframes
- Wireframes were created using Balsamiq.

In the case of new users, they will be invited to choose a password in addition to their email address.

#### About Me Section:
- This section has a brief introduction to the owner of the site, a background & also outlines her products. A 'Shop Now' button will sit here linking through to the Shop page

#### Price List per Product

#### Product Reviews
- This section sits underneath the Price List. It will contain various customer reviews of the merchandise, site, service, etc

### Features to be implemented in future:
* As the owner is originally from Spain & does some business there, it is hoped to add a bilingual option (English & Spanish) which will translate the page into the appropriate language.
* A link that opens an email in the user's default environment when they want to email the owner is not yet currently set up.
* Currently there are no live Social Media pages for the business - once these are created, these links will be amended correctly. At the moment, they merely point to the home page of the respective site.
* There isn't functionality yet to join the site or send feedback - this will be implemented in future.
* There isn't functionality to purchase online - this will be added at a future date.

* The first time user should clearly be able to understand the site & its aims.
    - The 'Welcome to...' section on the Landing Page (the Home Page) gives an overview of the site and its objectives.
* As the first time user is interested in crafting products, the user should be easily able to navigate the site, understand the layout of the site and where to find the desired content.
    - The Navbar at the top of each screen is an easily navigable method for the site, and each link will take the user to the desired section.

#### Returning Users
* Returning Users may wish to examine the site more closely, understand how to contact & interact with the site owners.
    - Contact Details for the site owner is given on each page & also links to the various Social Media platforms.
    - There is also a section on the 'Shop' page inviting the user to leave feedback about the site & products.
* They may be interested in subscribing to the site & so be kept aware of new products, blogs, etc.
    - There is a Subscription button on each page, inviting the user to sign up to receive updates, new merchandise, etc.
* They may wish to have increased interaction with the site owners either through the site or through social media.
    - As well as the Contact Details & Social Media links, there is also a Customer Reviews section on the 'Shop' page inviting the user to leave feedback about the site & products.

#### Frequent Users
* Frequent Users may be interested in purchasing products.
    - An Order Form on the 'Shop' page invites the user to purchase goods.

    - This site gives the Owner a presence on the web.
    - There is a Carousel of Images where the Owner can display a sample of her crafts.
    - There is a 'Shop' page where customers can place an order for goods.
* The site owner wishes to have an easy-to-follow site that can be updated regularly with new products, new blogposts, new layouts, etc.
    - The site is an easy-to-follow tool and any amendments, updates, new posts, etc, can be easily uploaded to the page.
* The site owner also would like to see clear links between the site and the various social media platforms. 
    - The footer of each pages contains links to the various Social Media pages for the business.

#### HTML Validator
* Passing my HTML code through the Validator resulted in small errors in my coding for the Order Form on the Shop page, where some label ID attributes were not unique, which have subsequently been corrected.
* One additional error was found - in my navbar links, I have a button element as a child of a ul element. This has been resolved by taking the 'button' element out of the 'ul' element. A subsequent validation run showed no errors in the code.

#### CSS Validator
* No errors found on my code using this validator.

***

## Bugs

* Bug: White space appearing above footer bar.
* Fix: This occurred because the 'Container-Fluid' class on the footer has a default top margin of 16px. Zeroing this removed the space.

* Bug: White bars appearing above and below footer bar.
* Fix: On Developer Tool, I could see two unicode characters before and after the footer bar code, however I could not see these in the code I had written.
     To get past this, I cut the code out into a word document, deleted anything (hidden or visible) in the code, then pasted back in the code. I then cleared the cache before refreshing and the spaces had left.

* Bug: A space appearing between the Price List Header & Table on the Shop page. 
* Fix: Using Developer Tool, a 'hr' tag can been seen between the two. However on the code, this does not appear. I attempted to remove the tag in a similar fashion to the second Bug above, but this did not resolve it. Following the advice of Daisy McGirr in the Slack community, I simply added a 'hr' function to my CSS file and styled it to remove margins, etc and set the 'display' to 'none'. then adjusted the width of the Price Header element to match the table.  

* Bug: Navbar links not being coloured as the other text in the navbar & footers.
* Fix: I had incorrectly targeted this part of the navbar code in my CSS code - Developer Tools was able to point out exactly the element that I needed to target to style correctly.

* Bug: Issue where Price Header title was not sitting perfectly on the price table in desktop view
* Fix: Adjusting the width to a fraction of a percent looks to have fixed this.

* At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the 'Settings' Button on the menu, locate the 'Fork' Button.
* You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.


### Local Clone

To make a local clone of the site, follow these steps:
* Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
