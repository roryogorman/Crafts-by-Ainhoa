### Structure of Website
The website consists of three interlinked pages, outlined below:
#### 1. The Home Page
This page is divided into 4 parts:
#### The Navigation Bar:
- The Navigation Bar ('Nav') sits atop this page. Contained in this bar, from left-to-right, are:
    - a. The site's logo
    - b. A bilingual option for the page - to toggle the language between English & Spanish. This is done at the owner's request due to nationality and the desire to market in Spain. For the purposes of MS1, while the toggle option is there, the language of the site will be in English only.
    - c. Links to the other pages in the site i.e. 'Gallery' and 'Shop'. Clicking on these links will bring you directly to the page, but in the same browser.
    - d. A 'Join/Sign In' button - the owner wishes to invite the user to subscribe to the site in order to be kept updated on new products, services, etc. Clicking on this button produces a pop-up form, requesting the user's ID (their email address) and password. In the case of new users, they will be invited to choose a password in addition to their email address.
#### Headline Section:
- The Headline Section contains a Hero Image which will be a stock image of craftwork materials - wool & yarn. I feel that this is appropriate for the site and gives the viewer a visual of what this site is about. A headline overlaying on this gives the name of the site.

### Design 
#### Colour Scheme
- To reflect the subject matter & aims of the site, I will be using soft, bright colours throughout the site e.g. soft yellows, oranges, purples, etc. I feel that using these shades adds to the attractiveness of the site and is very appropriate.

#### Typography
- Two fonts were used primarily for this site - 'Roboto' & 'Lato'. These are two fonts that are commonly used in websites and are both clean, clear & very readable and so I feel are appropriate for this site
- For the 'Shop Now' buttons, I have used the 'Rochester' font. I feel that it looks artistic & it fits to the overrall feel of the site.
- From researching other leading craft websites e.g. lovecrafts.com & mookko.co.uk, these sites use typography such as these throughout which makes their sites look very attractive.
