### Design 
#### Colour Scheme
- To reflect the subject matter & aims of the site, I will be using soft colours throughout the site e.g. soft yellows, oranges, purples, etc. I feel that using these shades adds to the attractiveness of the site and is very appropriate.
- The main colour used as a background for the NavBar & Footer is #989572 - a dark grayish yellow which I feel suits the pupose of the webiste well, and also blends very well with the background image.
- Other colours have been chosen which complement the #989572 colour. These are:
    - a. #E0D8DE: A warm grey colour, used as the text colour
    - b. #727598: A dark grayish blue colour, used as a colour for the 'Shop Now' button, as well as the hover colour for social media icons. 
    - c. #957298: A dark grayish magenta colour, used as a background for the User Review section.

#### Typography
- Two fonts were used primarily for this site - 'Rochester' & 'Baskerville'. These are two fonts that are commonly used in craft websites and are both clean, clear & very readable and so I feel are appropriate for this site
- For the 'Site Title' in the NavBar & 'Shop Now' buttons, I have used the 'Rochester' font. I feel that it looks artistic & it fits to the overrall feel of the site.
- From researching other leading craft websites e.g. lovecrafts.com & mookko.co.uk, these sites use typography such as these throughout which makes their sites look very attractive.

#### Imagery
For a site that will be primarily used to sell the merchandise of the vendor, imagery is hugely important - having a visual site with just the necessary commentary is usual practice for site such as this.
As such, I have used stock imagery for background 'hero' images on each page and have used images of products already created by the vendor in the Gallery tab. This gives the viewer a clear visual representation of the subject matter, aims and purposes of this site.

### Features to be implemented in future:

* A link that opens an email in the user's default environment when they want to email the owner is not yet curently set up.
* Currently there are no 'live' Social Media pages for the business - once these are created, these links will be amended correctly. At the monent, the merely point to the home page of the respective site.
* There isnt functionality yet to join the site or send feedback - this will be implemented in future.
* There isnt functionality to purchase online - this will be added at a future date.
